/**
 * Desktop notification delivery, behind one seam.
 *
 * Native first, through Wails' own notifications service, because the renderer
 * runs in a WKWebView where the Web Notification API is usually absent -- and
 * where, when it is present, it is not what macOS shows in Notification Centre.
 *
 * The Web API stays as the fallback for one real case: Wails only delivers
 * from a packaged, signed bundle, so `wails3 task dev` and the plain Vite
 * preview would otherwise be silent.
 *
 * Callers get a boolean rather than an exception. A banner that could not be
 * shown is not a failure worth surfacing -- the alert is already in the bell.
