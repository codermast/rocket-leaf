/**
 * Service Bus's view of the canonical routing shapes.
 *
 * The keys are a contract with internal/driver/azureservicebus/routing.go.
 *
 * A rule is what decides which of a topic's messages reach one subscription,
 * and it is an object rather than a field: it has a name, several may sit on
 * one subscription, and each is a filter plus an optional action that rewrites
 * the message on the way in. That is why this page exists at all - every other
 * family here keeps its filtering on the reader, where it is a setting.
 *
 * It arrives as a canonical Binding because the routing page is shared. The
 * mapping is exact rather than approximate: the source is the topic, the
 * destination is the subscription, the routing key is the filter, and the
 * properties key is the rule's name - which is genuinely the handle, since a
 * rule is deleted by name.
