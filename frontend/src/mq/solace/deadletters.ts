 * The keys are a contract with internal/driver/solace/deadletter.go.
 *
 * Two facts arrive on the source rather than on the target, and both change
 * what an empty dead message queue means:
 *
 *   - which kind of endpoint points here. A queue and a topic endpoint are
 *     configured in different places, so a reader fixing one has to know which
 *     they are looking at.
 *   - whether that endpoint moves everything or only what a publisher marked.
 *     respectDmqEligible is on by default and most clients mark nothing, so an
 *     endpoint can point at a perfectly good queue and never move a message.
