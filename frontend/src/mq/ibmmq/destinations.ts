/**
 * IBM MQ's view of a canonical destination.
 *
 * The keys are a contract with internal/driver/ibmmq/destination.go.
 *
 * One list holds two kinds of object, and `kind` is what separates them. A
 * queue is a store an application opens by name; a topic is a place a
 * publication is matched against. They share a page because they share a
 * vocabulary from an application's side - both are opened by name - and
 * nothing else about them is alike, which is why almost every column below is
 * null for one of the two.
 *
 * `topicString` is the field worth reading twice. A topic object's name is not
 * what publishers use: they name a string, and the object is where that
 * string's settings are attached. A board that showed only the object name
 * could not tell a reader where to publish.
