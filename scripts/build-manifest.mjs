/*
 * Writes the release manifest that the in-app updater and the website both read.
 *
 * It replaces the GitHub releases API as the answer to "what is the newest
 * version and which files does it have": a static JSON object any mirror can
 * serve, so a client that cannot reach github.com can still both check and
 * download. Which mirror it uses is decided at runtime by the client, not here.
 *
 * Every digest is inlined rather than left to the SHA256SUMS.txt beside the
 * packages. That makes the manifest the only thing a client has to trust - a
 * mirror carries bytes but cannot lie about them - and removes a separate
 * request that could fail on its own, which is exactly how the failure this
 * replaces was reported.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   RELEASE_TAG=v0.1.0 node scripts/build-manifest.mjs \
 *     --dir release-files --notes notes.md --out release-files/manifest.json
